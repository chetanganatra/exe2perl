DETAILS
Vulnerable systems: Perl2exe version 5.03

Background:
<http://www.indigostar.com/> Perl2Exe is a command line program for
converting perl scripts to exe files. This allows you to create stand
alone programs in perl that do not require the perl interpreter. You can
ship the exe file without having to ship your perl source code.

What does the tool do?

The tool is able to extract the plain text version of the encrypted perl script.
